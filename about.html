     <h2>Our Local Chapter</h2>
     <p>fbla is a natl org it does stuff we go to states and nationals and compete and do local stuff and sell chocolate and have fun</p>
     <h2>Competitive Events</h2>
     <p>WV FBLA encourages members to participate in competitive events that are held at the regional, state, and national level. Events are generally focused in business fields-- including marketing, advertising, and finance. The regional level is hosted at WVHS, the state level in East Brunswick, and nationals at any decided location in the USA (2016 will be held in Atlanta, GA). The State and National Leadership Conferences offer workshops and seminars for competitors and non-competitors alike. The SLC allows for networking with students across New Jersey, while the NLC expands that to across the nation. Both conferences are held in quality hotels and usually are overnight trips (SLC 2 nights, NLC anywhere between 2 and 5). We encourage students to get involved, as the possibility of placing at the state and even national level would be excellent resume boosters!</p>
     <h2>State and National Activity</h2>
     <p>WV FBLA has had tremendous success in competitive events, with many students qualifying for the State Leadership Conference and some proceeding to the National Leadership Conference. Many of our executive board members participate at the state level as members of the various NJ FBLA committees. 
In the 2014-2015 year, committee members included: Alex Park, Max Vorcheimer, Carrington Park, Stephanie Tang, Komal Nerurkar, Jamie Clauson, and Kevin Guo. They represented our chapter in the Presidentâ€™s Action Council, Publicity Committee, Community Service Committee, Parliamentary Procedure Council, and the Membership Committee. WV FBLA is proud to have produced state officers and even a national president.</p>
