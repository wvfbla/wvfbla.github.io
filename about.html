     <h2>Our Local Chapter</h2>
     <p>FBLA is a well-known high school extracurricular program that is considered "the largest and oldest business student organization in the world." Our local WV FBLA chapter follows its own traditions while still being an active chapter on the State and National level. Locally, WV FBLA prides itself on running the school store, The Trading Post, offering multiple sport tournaments throughout the year, and organizing the infamous Gertrude Hawk chocolate sale. Any fundraising efforts go towards lowering the cost of attending State and National conferences, with over 20 members attending the State Leadership conference at no cost last year. A chapter with a rich history of success locally and nationally, members of the Wayne Valley FBLA chapter are always finding ways to enhance that history and make their own marks.</p>
     <h2>Competitive Events</h2>
     <p>WV FBLA encourages members to participate in competitive events that are held at the regional, state, and national level. Events are generally focused in business fields-- including marketing, advertising, and finance. The regional level is hosted at WVHS, the state level in East Brunswick, and nationals at any decided location in the USA (2016 will be held in Atlanta, GA). The State and National Leadership Conferences offer workshops and seminars for competitors and non-competitors alike. The SLC allows for networking with students across New Jersey, while the NLC expands that to across the nation. Both conferences are held in quality hotels and usually are overnight trips (SLC 2 nights, NLC anywhere between 2 and 5). We encourage students to get involved, as the possibility of placing at the state and even national level would be excellent resume boosters!</p>
     <h2>State and National Activity</h2>
     <p>WV FBLA has had tremendous success in competitive events, with many students qualifying for the State Leadership Conference and some proceeding to the National Leadership Conference. Many of our executive board members participate at the state level as members of the various NJ FBLA committees. 
In the 2014-2015 year, committee members included: Alex Park, Max Vorcheimer, Carrington Park, Stephanie Tang, Komal Nerurkar, Jamie Clauson, and Kevin Guo. They represented our chapter in the President’s Action Council, Publicity Committee, Community Service Committee, Parliamentary Procedure Council, and the Membership Committee. WV FBLA is proud to have produced state officers and even a national president.</p>
